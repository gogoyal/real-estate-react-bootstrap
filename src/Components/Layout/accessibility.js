              If you find a keyboard or mouse difficult to use, speech
              recognition software such as DragonÂ® NaturallySpeaking may help
              you navigate web pages and online services. This software allows
              the user to move focus around a web page or application screen
              through voice controls.

                Transcripts: A text transcript is a text equivalent of audio
                information that includes spoken words and non-spoken sounds
                such as sound effects.

                Captioning: A caption is a transcript for the audio track of a
                video presentation that is synchronized with the video and audio
                tracks. Captions are generally rendered visually by being
                superimposed over the video, which benefits people who are deaf
                and hard-of-hearing, and anyone who cannot hear the audio (e.g.,
                when in a crowded room). Learn how to turn captioning on and off

                Volume controls: Your computer, tablet, or mobile device has
                volume control features. Each video and audio service has
                additional volume controls. Try adjusting both your device's
                volume controls and your media players' volume controls to
                optimize your listening experience.
